## Getting Setup

This project requires two main programs to be run in order for the EAT System to operate as intended.

Assuming the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 is already configured following the document "Pi Connections" found in the SharePoint.

### **Dependencies**

The following packages and files are dependencies for `eatMain.py`

**Local File**

- DF_Oxygen.py is a local library file that must be in the same directory

**Packages**

- sensor https://github.com/nickoala/sensor
- RPi.GPIO https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/
- matplotlib https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html
- numpy https://numpy.org/
- Need specific version 1.20.0 to work with Python 3.9
- gpiozero https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html
- pyDrive https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/

```
packages = [
    "sensor",
    "RPi.GPIO",
    "matplotlib",
    "numpy==1.20.0",
    "gpiozero",
    "pydrive"
]
```

Run the following setup script to install necessary packages and cleanup the GPIO pins.

```
python eatSetup.py
```

To operate EAT normally run:

```
python eatMain.py
```

Notes:
This project uploads images and plots to Google Drive, you will need to re-download the client-secrets from the Project's Google Account before rerunning this code.

Following this page for Authentication:
